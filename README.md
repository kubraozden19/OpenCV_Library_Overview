# OpenCV Library Overview

In this section, we will learn some functions used in the OpenCV library in Google Colab.

<hr />

ðŸ“Œ OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
